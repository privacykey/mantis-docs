A built-in webhook capture, only enabled with `ENABLE_DEV_INBOX=1`:

- `ANY http://localhost:3000/inbox/<any-path>` — captures the request into a 100-entry in-memory ring buffer; request bodies over 1 MiB return `413 payload_too_large`, and stored/displayed bodies are truncated after 64 KiB
- `GET /inbox` — live-updating viewer (polls every 1s, pretty-prints JSON bodies)
- `GET /api/inbox` — same data as JSON; supports `?slug=foo&since=<id>`. Requires an API key or dashboard session.
- `DELETE /api/inbox` — clear the buffer. Requires an API key or dashboard session.

The `/inbox/<slug>` capture endpoint is unauthenticated by design so it can receive webhooks, but reading or clearing the captured buffer requires operator auth.

Use it as your webhook target while developing, instead of webhook.site. State is in-memory only — it resets when the server restarts. Do not expose it in production.
