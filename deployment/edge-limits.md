Mantis trigger URLs are intentionally public. Put coarse limits at the first
public edge so abusive traffic is dropped before it reaches Node, Postgres, or
the notification queue.

## Recommended baseline

Use these as starting values, then adjust for your traffic:

| Surface | Methods | URL limit | Body limit | Rate limit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `/c/*` | `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST` | 2 KB | 16 KB | 120/min/IP |
| `/status/*` | `GET`, `HEAD` | 1 KB | 0 | 240/min/IP |
| `/api/wallet/*` | Wallet methods | 4 KB | 64 KB | 120/min/IP |
| `/inbox*`, `/api/inbox` | dev only | 2 KB | 64 KB | private/dev only |

Notes:

- `/c/:public_id` only needs a short public ID and an optional short `src`
  query parameter. A 2 KB URI ceiling is generous.
- Mantis does not need request bodies on `/c/*`; `POST` is accepted only for
  clients that can only signal by POST.
- If you intentionally embed long attribution in query strings, raise the URL
  limit for `/c/*` and keep the app's storage caps in sync.
- Node's default HTTP request-header limit is 16 KiB. Railway's public proxy
  allows 32 KB combined headers. The app stores request fields with caps above
  the Node default so normal accepted traffic is preserved.

## Cloudflare Tunnel or Cloudflare in front of any host

Cloudflare is the cleanest place to enforce app-layer limits for public Mantis
URLs. Rules only apply when the DNS record is proxied through Cloudflare.

### Custom rule: reject oversized public URLs

Dashboard path:

1. Cloudflare dashboard -> your zone -> Security -> WAF -> Custom rules.
2. Create a rule named `mantis public URL limits`.
3. Expression:

```text
(
  starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/c/")
  and len(http.request.uri) > 2048
)
or
(
  starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/status/")
  and len(http.request.uri) > 1024
)
or
(
  starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/wallet/")
  and len(http.request.uri) > 4096
)
or
(
  starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/inbox")
  or starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/inbox")
)
```

4. Action: `Block`.
5. Deploy.

If you changed `MANTIS_PUBLIC_PATH`, replace `/c/` with that path.

### Rate limiting rules

Dashboard path:

1. Security -> WAF -> Rate limiting rules.
2. Create one rule for `/c/*`:
   - Expression: `starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/c/")`
   - Characteristics: IP address
   - Period: 60 seconds
   - Requests: 120
   - Mitigation timeout: 60 seconds
   - Action: Block or Managed Challenge
3. Create one rule for `/status/*`:
   - Expression: `starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/status/")`
   - Characteristics: IP address
   - Period: 60 seconds
   - Requests: 240
   - Mitigation timeout: 60 seconds
   - Action: Block
4. If Apple Wallet is enabled, create one rule for `/api/wallet/*`:
   - Expression: `starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/wallet/")`
   - Characteristics: IP address
   - Period: 60 seconds
   - Requests: 120
   - Mitigation timeout: 60 seconds
   - Action: Block

Request body-size matching with `http.request.body.size` is an Enterprise
feature. On Free/Pro/Business plans, enforce body size in an origin proxy
such as nginx/Caddy or rely on Mantis not reading `/c/*` bodies.

## Railway

Railway has useful network limits, but not an app-layer WAF. Railway documents
a 32 KB combined header limit, about 11,000 requests/sec per domain, and L4
DDoS mitigation; it explicitly recommends Cloudflare when you need WAF
functionality.

Recommended Railway setup:

1. Deploy Mantis on Railway as usual.
2. Add a custom domain in Railway.
3. Put that hostname in Cloudflare DNS with the orange cloud enabled.
4. Add the Cloudflare custom and rate limiting rules above.
5. Set `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1` only when Cloudflare is the public entry point.

Without Cloudflare, keep `MANTIS_DUPLICATE_LOG_LIMIT` low and use hit
retention so known URLs cannot grow the database indefinitely.

Railway references:

- [Pricing](https://docs.railway.com/pricing)
- [Redis service](https://docs.railway.com/guides/redis)

### Railway Redis/Valkey for shared rate limiting

Mantis does not require Redis/Valkey by default. Adding it on Railway means
running another always-on service. Based on Railway's current usage pricing:

- RAM is billed at $10/GB-month.
- CPU is billed at $20/vCPU-month by actual usage.
- Volume storage is $0.15/GB-month.
- Hobby has a $5/month minimum that counts toward usage.

A small Redis/Valkey limiter using 256 MB of RAM costs about $2.50/month in RAM
before CPU and storage. If your Mantis app plus Postgres are still under the
Hobby included usage, it may not change the bill; otherwise it adds a few
dollars per month. Performance is usually fine for a limiter, but every `/c/*`
hit adds a private-network round trip before the DB insert. Prefer Cloudflare
or provider edge limits first, then add Redis/Valkey only if you run multiple
Mantis replicas or need strict shared counters.

## Fly.io

Fly's `http_service.concurrency` protects each Machine from too many concurrent
requests, but it is not a per-IP rate limiter or WAF. The example
`deploy/fly.toml.example` already uses request-based concurrency.

Recommended Fly setup:

1. Keep `type = "requests"` with a hard limit your VM can actually handle.
2. Use a Cloudflare-proxied custom domain for the public hostname if the
   Mantis URL will be exposed broadly.
3. Add the Cloudflare rules above.

Fly reference:

- [Concurrency settings](https://fly.io/docs/apps/concurrency/)

## Render

Render provides DDoS protection automatically, but application-layer abuse is
still your responsibility. Use a Cloudflare-proxied custom domain if you need
per-path URL and rate limits before traffic reaches the service.

## Tailscale Funnel

Tailscale Funnel is convenient, but it is not a full WAF. Use split mode from
[`tailscale.md`](/deployment/tailscale) so only public routes are exposed, and keep
dashboard/API traffic on the private Serve hostname.

For stricter public limits with Tailscale:

1. Prefer Cloudflare Tunnel if you own a domain and want edge rules.
2. Or put nginx/Caddy between the Funnel sidecar and Mantis, then point
   Tailscale Serve/Funnel at that local proxy instead of `mantis:3000`.

Minimal nginx location shape:

```nginx
client_max_body_size 16k;
large_client_header_buffers 4 8k;

location /c/ {
  limit_except GET HEAD POST { deny all; }
  limit_req zone=mantis_trigger burst=20 nodelay;
  proxy_pass http://mantis:3000;
}

location /status/ {
  limit_except GET HEAD { deny all; }
  limit_req zone=mantis_status burst=20 nodelay;
  proxy_pass http://mantis:3000;
}
```

You would also need a matching `limit_req_zone` in nginx's `http` block. This
is intentionally not in the default compose file because it adds another moving
part for the common personal setup.

## Local Docker

The compose file binds Mantis to `127.0.0.1` by default. That is the best local
limit: no public edge exists. If you set `MANTIS_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`, put a
local reverse proxy in front before exposing it to untrusted networks.
